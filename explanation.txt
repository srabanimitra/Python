LRU Page Replacement Algorithm
==============================

Author: Srabani Mitra (20220104111)

Description:
------------
This project implements the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm
using Python. The algorithm ensures that selecting the victim page (least recently
used) is done in O(1) time.

Data Structures Used:
---------------------
- OrderedDict from collections:
  * Maintains the order of page usage.
  * Allows moving recently used pages to the front.
  * Provides O(1) operations for insertion, deletion, and updates.

Efficiency:
-----------
- Victim selection (finding the LRU page) is O(1) because we always remove the
  last item from the OrderedDict.
- Updating the most recently used page is also O(1).

How to Run:
-----------
On Windows:
    run.bat

On Linux/Mac:
    ./run.sh

Or directly:
    python main.py

Sample Input:
-------------
Capacity = 4
Pages = [7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2]

Sample Output:
--------------
Referencing page: 7
Current frame state: 7
Referencing page: 0
Current frame state: 0 7
Referencing page: 1
Current frame state: 1 0 7
Referencing page: 2
Current frame state: 2 1 0 7
Referencing page: 0
Current frame state: 0 2 1 7
Referencing page: 3
Page replaced: 7
Current frame state: 3 0 2 1
Referencing page: 0
Current frame state: 0 3 2 1
